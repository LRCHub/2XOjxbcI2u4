We make funds
They make guns
Bigger ones
Kill the sons

It's like everybody's got a criminal conviction
How can you say that with conviction
It's who I am Polygram
F**k you niggers
F**k you niggers
Who I am Polygram

It's alright with me
If you don't like the sight of me
Don't lie to me
Do you like the inside of me
I wanna own the whole music industry
And everything in it
Wait a minute
Let my people sing it
Not just black people
All people, everybody's welcome
And everybody who disagrees can shove off
I'm frustrated
Lyrical paradin'
Do I have to be Italian to make it
I wanna get hooked up
Quit lookin' poor in me
What'd you call me

If you got money, would you
You're alright with me

All people, all races
Everybody's welcome
And everybody who disagrees shove off
I'm frustrated
Lyrical paradin'
Guns, grenades
Do I have to
I'm frustrated
Guns, grenades
Do I have to be Italian to be made
I wanna get hooked up
Quit lookin' poor in me
What'd you call me
What'd you call me

I wanna own the whole music industry
And everything in it
Wait a minute
Let my people sing it
Not just black people
All people, everybody's welcome
